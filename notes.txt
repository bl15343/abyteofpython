Python notes:
======================

While loops can have an else condition that is evaluated
after the while conditional evaluates to false. This is true only if
you do not exit the while loop with a break statement.

For loops can have an else condition that is evalauted after
the for loop finishes unless a break condition is encountered. The range operator is exclusive on the closing
range. (1,5) 1,2,3,4
